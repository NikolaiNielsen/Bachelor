# Bachelor - Visualization of Concepts in Condensed Matter Physics
This repository stores my bachelors project in Physics from the University of Copenhagen, under the supervision of Mark Spencer Rudner.

The source code is located in the cmp folder, along with a rawtext installation guide and a list of packages used.

## Abstract
In this thesis we explore key concepts in the field of condensed matter physics and translate these into visualisations using the computer programming language Python. Concepts explored include the geometry of crystal structures, families of lattice planes, neutron scattering and the band structure of two dimensional materials. Four distinct programs are written to visualize each of these concepts, and they are bundled into one open-source software package available at https://github.com/NikolaiNielsen/Bachelor, along with documentation on its use.
