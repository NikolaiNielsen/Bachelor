## Code todo

#### lattice planes
- [X] fix when $d$ os outside of lattice
- [ ] also show reciprocal lattice when plotting lattice planes
- [ ] show b1, b2, b3 (h,k,l actually)
- [ ] rotate both figures simultaniously
- [ ] checkbox to toggle gridlines on reciprocal lattice
- [ ] dynamic changing of n/m min and n/m max

#### scattering
- [ ] hide basis stuff for preset bases
- [ ] transfer notes to tooltips
- [ ] label on detection plane
- [ ] recreate with two figures, one macroscopic, one microscopic
- [ ] show scattering triangle only on microscopic figure
- [ ] show lattice planes only on microscopic figure
- [ ] make detection screen always square (and only on macroscopic view)

#### general
- [ ] check out other libraries (mayavi2, plotly, etc)
