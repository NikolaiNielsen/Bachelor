## Thesis writing to-do list

Abstract

Introduction

- [ ] General theory: 1D tight-binding chain to illustrate examples
- [x] Thoughts on Python

Lattice plotting
- [x] Theory on lattices
- [x] Step-by-step of the program
- [ ] Considerations with regards to "pretty" plotting (gridlines, limiting plot box, rotating lattices)
- [ ] Plots of various lattices
- [ ] Plots of various "wrongs" (incomplete unit cells)

Reciprocal lattice and scattering
- [x] Theory on reciprocal lattice (and lattice planes)
- [x] Theory on scattering (Laue and Bragg conditions, and how they relate for calculation of scattering amplitudes)
- [x] Simulating a "real" neutron scattering experiment
- [ ] Step-by-step of program
- [ ] plots of lattice planes
- [ ] plots of scattering simulation

2D Band structure
- [x] periodic potentials and V_G
- [x] Fourier transform of the Schr√∂dingers equation
- [x] Discretising the equation and creating the matrix equation
- [ ] Step-by-step of the program
- [ ] plots of 2D band structure for different V0 and maybe different potentials?
