- [ ] Plots of various lattices
- [ ] Plots of various "wrongs" (incomplete unit cells)

Reciprocal lattice and scattering
- [ ] Theory on reciprocal lattice (and lattice planes)
- [ ] Theory on scattering (Laue and Bragg conditions, and how they relate for calculation of scattering amplitudes)
- [ ] Simulating a "real" neutron scattering experiment
- [ ] Step-by-step of program
- [ ] plots of lattice planes
