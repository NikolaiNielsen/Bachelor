lattice plotting
    - Automatic classifying should work properly (non-uniqueness of vectors)
    - Hexagonal close packing
    - basis with lattice preset
    - Jagged edges on uncommon lattices.
    - Input parameters and presets as default. Free inputs as optional
    - Graphical user interface?
        - Two windows? one matplotlib, one control
        - embedded in a larger application? (Look at QT framework)
        - Dropdown shows only relevant parameters
scattering
    - Better explanation of detection screen
    - Text on vecttors when highlighting.
    - Checkboxes for showing all
    - dropdown for highlighting
fermi surface
- Intersecting planes (need OpenGL compliant)
- Strong potential limit for harmonic (Find out why 1 is the strong potential limit)



Other stuff
- Remember requirements.txt for proper versioning.
- virtual environments


Separate the lattice calculation into separate file for exercise
Implement basis
Default parameters for lattices (change back when lattice is changed)
