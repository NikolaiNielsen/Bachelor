lattice plotting
    - Hexagonal close packing
    - Jagged edges on uncommon lattices.
scattering
    - Better explanation of detection screen
    - Text on vecttors when highlighting.
    - Checkboxes for showing all
    - dropdown for highlighting
fermi surface
- Intersecting planes (need OpenGL compliant)
- Strong potential limit for harmonic (Find out why 1 is the strong potential limit)

Default parameters for lattices (change back when lattice is changed)
