Fix when d is outside of the lattice (lattice planes)
Delete base centred cubic
Specify primitive/conventional for bcc/fcc
Show also reciprocal lattice when plotting lattice planes (points instead of balls)
 - show b1, b2, b3 (h,k,l actually)
 - try rotating boths
 - checkbox to show/hide og gridlines
 - dynamic changing of n/m min and n/m max


Scattering
- hide basis stuff for bcc and fcc
- Add "restricted" simple cubic. so 3 presets and one "free" simple cubic
- figure out scattering triangle arrow heads
- try notes on hover
- default to show all
- more distance between figures
- label on detection plane 
- try two different figures (for main and detection screen)
- Two main views: one microscopic and one macroscopic.Sync rotation
- Only show lattice planes on the microscopic view
- Make detection screen always square (main view)
